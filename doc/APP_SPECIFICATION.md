# Ontology Application APDU Interface

## About

This document outlines the APDU messages interface for interacting with the Ontology application. The application supports communication over HID or BLE interfaces

### Supported Functionalities

The Ontology application provides the following features:

- Get Public Address: Retrieve an Ontology public address given a BIP-32 derivation path.
- Sign Transaction: Sign an Ontology transaction using a BIP-32 derivation path and a raw transaction.
- Get App Version: Retrieve the version of the Ontology application.
- Get App Name: Retrieve the name of the Ontology application.

The application interface can be accessed over HID or BLE

## APDUs

### Get Ontology Public Address

#### Description

This command retrieves the public key corresponding to a specified BIP-32 derivation path. Optionally, the associated address can be displayed on the device for user verification before being returned.
